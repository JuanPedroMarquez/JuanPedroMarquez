# 👋 Hi, I’m Juan Pedro! Welcome to my Github Profile 😁
## I am an Economist. I studied my bachelors degree in the University of A Coruña and a Master in Economics in the Carlos 3 University of Madrid (UC3M). <br><br> I received deep formation in microeconomics, macroeconomics, statistics and econometrics subjects, which made me a statistics passionate and enjoyer. <br><br> I am currently redirecting my professional career towards the Data Analysis by learning Python, MySQL and Azure. <br> In addition to that, I also have worked with other programs such as RStudio, Stata, EViews, Gretl and MatLab in diverse economic contexts (linear regressions, non-linear regressions, time series analysis, forecasting, economic modeling, Impulse-Response Function of the economy in the case of a shock, etc.).

### About Me!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, focused mainly in libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and beginning to learn about statistics libraries! Furthermore, I have received some basics about MySQL and Microsoft Azure.
- 🌍 I live in Galicia, Spain, and I am 23 years old.
- 🎸 I like heavy metal and videogames.
- 👀 I like Statistics and Data Analysis.
- 🤣 I like memes.

I hope that I can build an interesting profile with cool projects for everyone to learn. My main language is spanish, but I will eventually upload my projects in English too so that it is more accessible to people. <br> That being said, have a very nice day!
